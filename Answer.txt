Question 1: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
  Answer: Java does not allow this because the constructor (overridden method) does not have to have the same name and the same signature (the same number and data types of method arguments).

Question 2: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
  Answer: Java is a Pass by Value programming language

Question 3:
  1. After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
  2. After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?

  Answers:
  1. Because Java is a Pass by Value programming language. The method swap() does not change the reference of the JungleDVD and the CinderellaDVD. It only changes the reference of the o1 and the o2.
  2. Because the method changeTitle() changes the title of the JungleDVD by the method setTitle().
