Question 1. What happens when users select "Cancel"?
	If users choose "Cancel," the variable 'option' is set to 2 prior to being compared with 'JOptionPane.YES_OPTION,' which holds a value of 1. Since 2 does not equal 1, the program will present the "No" message on the screen, as if the users had chosen 'No'.


Question 2. How to customize the options to users, e.g. only two options: “Yes” and “No”, OR “I do” and “I don’t”
	Instead of employing the 'showConfirmDialog' method, you can employ the 'showOptionDialog' method to tailor the choices for users. The 'showOptionDialog' method follows this syntax:

       int option = JOptionPane.showOptionDialog(
       null,
       "Do you want to switch to a first-class ticket?",
       "Choose an option",
       JOptionPane.YES_NO_OPTION,
       JOptionPane.QUESTION_MESSAGE,
       null,
       new String[] {"Yes", "No"},
       "Yes"
   );

	The 'showOptionDialog' method returns an integer value denoting the index of the user's choice. In the given example, selecting 'Yes' assigns a value of 0 to the 'option' variable, while opting for 'No' assigns a value of 1.
